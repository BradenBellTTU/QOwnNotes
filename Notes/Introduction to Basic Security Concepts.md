Introduction to Basic Security Concepts
========================

## Security Introduction
+ Two major sides in Information Assurance (IA) aka cybersecurity
    + **Defensive / Blue Team** - harder because they have to be right all the time
    + **Offensive / Red Team** - easier because you only have to be right once and gets many more tries

### Defensive operations
+ **Legal** (Security Control)

### Offensive Operations
+ **Illegal** (Security Violation)
    + Unintentional
        + Outsider
        + Insider
    + Intentional
        + Outsider
        + Insider
+ **Legal** (Security Testing aka, Penetration Testing)
    + Outsider working for insider
    + + Insider
    + 
+ **Legal & Illegal** (Cyberwarfare) 
    + Government /Agency against Gov./Agency (Nation State v. Nation State)
    + What's legal and illegal here? Depends on who wins or who you ask

<!-- IMPORTANT INFO -->
### **Attacker's Advantage & Defender's Dilemma**
+ **Principle 1:** The Defender must defend all points; the attacker can choose the weakest point
+ **Principle 2:** The Defender can defend only against known attacks; the attacker can probe for unknown vulreablilites
+ **Principle 3:** The Defender must be constantly vigilant; the attacker can strike at will
+ **Principle 4:** The defender must play by the rules; the attacker can play dirty

### CIA Triad
+ **Confidentiality**
    + Keeping data and resources hidden
+ **Integrity (Data & Origin)**
    + Keeping data (and data souces) and resources uncorrupted
+ **Availability**
    + Keeping data and resources usable
+ **Accountability (aka Non-Repudiation)**
    + Holding one accountable for action

### Offensive Goal
+ Theats and attacks -> Use Vulrebilities -> that cause harm/loss
+ Threats and attacks cause risk

#### Terms
+ **Threat** (potential violation of security)
    + Agent that can inflict harm to an asset or cause security violations
+ **Attack** (actions that cause violation to occur)
    + Infliction of harm to an asset or causing security violations
+ **Vulnerability** (elements which can be exploited)
    + A weakness in security procedures or system design, implementation or operation that acn be used to cause seurity policy violation
+ **Risk** (how likely will an event happen)
    +    Likelihood of ?

#### General Classes of Threats
+ **Disclusure** - unauthorized access to information
+ **Deception** - presentation/acceptance of false data
+ **Disruption** - interruption or prevention of correct operation
+ **Usurpation** - unauthorized control of some part of a system

<!-- Check slides for more notes. It's the table stuff in between the top and bottom info -->

#### Types of Attacks
+ Snooping/sniffing
+ Spoofing
+ Modification
+ Repudiation of Origin
+ Delay
+ Denial of Receipt
+ Denial of Service


### Defensive Goals
#### Venues for Security Controls
+ **Hardware**
+ **Software**
+ **Data**
    + In processing
    + In transit
    + In storage
+ **People**
